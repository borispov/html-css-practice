c# HTML_CSS_PRACTICE Let's RO0ck!

It has been a while since I last practiced pure html-css stuff, and I figured I'd just build something out.

Not sure what it is, but perhaps some landing page concept for Interior Design Store.

I am using a single index.html file along with some simple postCSS configuration to allow fun usage of CSS.
I don't use SCSS. Just css with cssNext features to make my life bit more easier with some nice functions.
